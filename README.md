# QuiaMalaeMemoriae
or Prius Obliviscor

The Main Goal is to compile first semester examples, re-evaluate and expand upon them.
Secondarily include own projects or examples from first semester.

Featuring:
- ported examples: BasicTypes, Excercise1, MyFirstObject, AbstractShapes, BirdInheritance
- customized ported examples: CountryCode, Excercise10 (more to be done)
- Got tired of all the simple pages, hit upon the idea of having a Demo method to replace the simpler code examples where stuff is done in the codebehind or the program file of a console app.
- StoryTeller: an adventure in XML, LINQ, Lists and Objects 






















Would you fork me? I'd fork me.
